###############################################################################

# This script provides an example of a PVC provisioner script. It will do
# nothing and return back to the provisioner without taking any action, and
# expecting no special arguments.

# This script can thus be used as an example or reference implementation of a
# PVC provisioner script and expanded upon as required.

# This script will run under root privileges as the provisioner does. Be careful
# with that.

# Installation function - performs a debootstrap install of a Debian system
# Note that the only arguments are keyword arguments.
def install(**kwargs):
    # The provisioner has already mounted the disks on kwargs['temporary_directory'].
    # by this point, so we can get right to running the debootstrap after setting
    # some nicer variable names; you don't necessarily have to do this.
    vm_name = kwargs['vm_name']
    temporary_directory = kwargs['temporary_directory']
    disks = kwargs['disks']
    networks = kwargs['networks']
    # No operation - this script just returns
    pass
