###############################################################################

# This script provides an example of a PVC monitoring plugin script. It will create
# a simple plugin to check the Zookeeper instance on the node for operation.

# This script can thus be used as an example or reference implementation of a
# PVC monitoring pluginscript and expanded upon as required.

# A monitoring plugin script must implement the class "MonitoringPluginScript" which
# extends "MonitoringPlugin", providing the 3 functions indicated. Detailed explanation
# of the role of each function is provided in context of the example; see the other
# examples for more potential uses.

# WARNING:
#
# This script will run in the context of the node daemon keepalives as root.
# DO NOT install untrusted, unvetted plugins under any circumstances.


# This import is always required here, as MonitoringPlugin is used by the
# MonitoringPluginScript class
from pvcnoded.objects.MonitoringInstance import MonitoringPlugin


# A monitoring plugin script must always expose its nice name, which must be identical to
# the file name
PLUGIN_NAME = "zkpr"


# The MonitoringPluginScript class must be named as such, and extend MonitoringPlugin.
